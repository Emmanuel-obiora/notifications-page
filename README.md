## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This challenge opened my eyes to huge world of possibilities. During the duration of this challenge I have learnt a lot about RESTful API's and to develop and depoloy them both locally and on live server's.


### Continued development

I will continue to learn more on the utilization of restful api's, and also ways to perform CRUD operations. Eventually this will help foster a better integration understanding when working on a full scale project.


### Useful resources

- [Installation and deployment of json-server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/json-server) - This helped me learnt what it meant to create restful API.
- [Deploying json-server on render](https://teckash.hashnode.dev/how-to-deploy-a-json-server-on-render) - This gave me a step by step guide on how to deploy on a live server
